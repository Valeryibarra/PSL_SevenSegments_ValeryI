# PSL_SevenSegments_ValeryI
Description:  Program that receives by console seven segments numbers and converts them into string  
###### Author: Valery Ibarra Iba√±ez  

## Assumptions:  
-If a segment is a digit [0, 9] it is assumed to be a NaN (Not a Number) and will be represented in the output as "x". 
-The program can read more than 3 lines, but they must be multiples of 3 (6,9,12, ...)  
-There must be a line break at the end.

## Description:
A string with a multiple number of 3  lines is entered through the command line. The string by means of the following characters "_" "|" will represent digit using the seven-segment theory. For this reason, each character has 3 spaces per line and has 3 lines
